## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

## Supported versions

## Security practices

- All secrets are required env vars with no defaults — the server won't start without them
- JWT secrets must be at least 32 characters
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- API input is validated with Zod schemas
- Cookies use `secure: true` in production
